## Introduction:
This is a simple application similar to the Pokemon Go game.
The main screen is a map screen with monsters within a radius of 1km from the player's current position. The app keeps track of the current location all the time and updates the list of monsters on the map and their labels.
All monsters in the area of level 5-25 are randomly generated. When catching a monster, experience is awarded. The essence of the game is pumping the character and catching new monsters.
